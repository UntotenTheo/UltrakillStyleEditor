# Ultrakill Style Editor
An easy solution to modifying in-game style hud text
# Compatibility
This plugin may be able to change other mods' style texts as well as long as they use the standard way of showing style text. When a custom style is detected for the first time, it is added to the unknown style section. Unknown styles can also be scanned by pressing the button on the unknown styles panel (which may work on a level). Unknown styles are remembered on reboot
# Possible issues
* There is no convenient way of completely changing ULTRARICOSHOT and its varients, as they are prefixes
